<p>Our climate change adaptation strategy revolves around the promotion and support of innovative adaptation options that address climatic risks along the livestock, agricultural inputs, and water value chains.

This contributes to sustainable market development, improved agricultural productivity and food and nutrition security in Kenya. These innovative options cut across from practical activities e.g. adoption of solar water pumping for utilities, to research for policy influence, such as providing evidence on contribution of climate change to sectors to inform county and national strategies on the same, especially activities to be prioritised for resilience creation.</p>
