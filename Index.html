<p>We now know that man-made climate change is real and that it poses a great threat to the planet and its inhabitants. Current data suggest that we need to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in developed countries by at least 80% by 2050 in order to have a chance of staying below an average temperature rise of over 2ÂºC 1. Factory farming is a major contributor to the climate change challenge, releasing vast volumes of greenhouse gases: so now we will learn about climate change in different countries!</p>
